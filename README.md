This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Utilizing the publicly available "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of labeled images categorized as either “NORMAL” or “PNEUMONIA,” the goal was to create an efficient binary classifier. The fastai library, built on top of PyTorch, was used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Images were resized to 128×128 pixels and augmented to improve generalization. Initially, a pretrained ResNet18 model was used, but due to performance constraints on Google Colab, a lightweight custom CNN was later implemented, significantly reducing training time while maintaining reasonable accuracy. The final model achieved around 90% validation accuracy and was evaluated using confusion matrices and loss visualization. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in assisting radiologists by automating pneumonia detection, particularly in resource-limited healthcare environments, and lays the foundation for future improvements like Grad-CAM visualization, mobile deployment, or real-time clinical use.
